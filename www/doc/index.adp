<h3>
introduction
</h3>
<p>
Q-Forms provides procedures for building forms dynamically in OpenACS tcl.
It is an OpenACS service package that allows convenient building and
interpreting of web-based forms via tcl in a web page.
</p><p>
Q-Forms procedures parallel html's form tags with many
automatic defaults that remove the tedious nature of building forms 
via html or an alternate form building context, such as OpenACS form
builder, ad_form or acs-templating.

<h3>
features
</h3>
<ul><li>
A form builder by declaration that is also an input validation event handler via <code>qfo_2g</code>. User interface operations are passed to the calling page once vallidation passes.
</li><li>
Low learning-curve:<ul><li>Uses tcl context.</li><li>Procedures match tags.</li><li>TCL list friendly.</li></ul>
</li><li>
Built-in API defaults: Takes less keystrokes to build a form than typing html manually.
</li><li>
Can build multiple forms concurently using Tcl file terminology.
</li><li>
No limitations to building dynamic forms with specialized inputs.
</li><li>
Form values are retrieved as a tcl array named by the programmer.
</li><li>
Form values are automatically quoted, a requirement of secure input handling.
</li><li>
Optional, automatic hash generation helps secure form transactions 
and ignores multiple posts caused from mouse double-clicks and browsing page history.
</li><li>
Passing multiple values of same input name can be combined as a list (instead of producing
a form post error typical of ad_form/ad_page_contract).
</li><li>
html can be inserted in any form at any point during the build.
</li><li>
No UI javascript is used. Technologies with limited UI, cpu power, or low QOS connection can use it.
</li><li>
Integrates with acs-templating features.
</li><li>
Integrates with q-tables for customizing forms, mainly adding ability to add extra fields and store info in a q-tables table. To activate feature, package implementing q-forms qfo_* procs requires a package parameter "enableQFormGenP" with value set to "1".
</li></ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>After installing package using standard OpenACS installation procedures,
Change the forms.css reference in the main site's acs-subsite parameter
<strong>ThemeCSS</strong> to point to '/resources/q-forms/forms.css' instead of '/resources/acs-templating/forms.css', or apply these two CSS rules to your site's theme:
<pre>
label {	
    display: block;
    }
input {
    margin: .5em;
    }
</pre>

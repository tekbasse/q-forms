Customization is enabled of a package if package:
1. has a parameter enableFormGenP
2. enableFormGenP is set to '1' 
3. q-tables is installed (enabled)
@see qfo_qtable_label_package_id



-----
Some logic behind the creation of separate packages: q-data-types and q-tables:
While designing a paradigm for customization of forms 
that expand on package/app form defaults
while forcing package/app specific requirements,
some axioms are noted.

1. Customization adds fields, doesn't change supplied ones.

2. Customization code should not be available by default to
ensure that default app/form behavior is not burdened with
complexity of customization features
or related bugs and performance degredation.
Customization adds complexity and therefore burdens app developer 
that must consider unknown possibilities during app design.
This burden/responsibility for implementing customizations should
be on the onus of customizers.

3. Package defaults need to be defined using simple,
     largely self-explanatory code to simplify declarations.

What is needed?  

field attributes for qf_input or qf_textarea
additional fields: data type for validation and view.

Tag attributes could default to ones provided by datatype.

Modified data types could provide customizations.
And yet, axiom 3 customization features should not be inherent.
Subsequently, q-data-types holds fixed data types.


Customizations are provided via q-tables (if installed).

Datatype refers to qss_tips_data_types (now q-data-types) 
except that doesn't work for defaults provided by q-forms only.

So, q-forms must have its own customizable qfo datatypes, 
yet a UI is needed to dynamically change this for web admins.

Furthermore, the spreadsheet package shouldn't require the customizations
per axiom 3.

Solution:

A qfo api that requires q-forms and q-data-types package.
Spreadsheet package requires q-data-types package.
Customizations of extending forms features require installing q-tables package.
